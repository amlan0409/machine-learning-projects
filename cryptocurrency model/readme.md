# üí∞ Cryptocurrency Price Prediction System

This project uses the autots (Automated Time Series) library to automatically find the best forecasting model to predict the closing price of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the next 30 days.

## üìÅ Project Contents

- **cryptocurrency price prediction.ipynb** ‚Äì Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and forecasting visualizations.  
- **crypto_prices.csv / dataset.xlsx** ‚Äì Dataset containing historical cryptocurrency data (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are **highly volatile** and unpredictable.  
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can **forecast future crypto prices** (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) based on historical patterns, enabling better portfolio and risk management decisions.

## üîç Workflow Overview

### üß© Data Ingestion: 
- Downloads the last 730 days (2 years) of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) historical data from Yahoo Finance.


### ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation:
-  Cleans the data, formats the Date column, and selects the Close price for forecasting. 


### ü§ñ Visualization: 
Models experimented with:
- Generates an interactive candlestick chart using Plotly to visualize the historical price movements.
  

### üìä Correlation Analysis: 
- Checks the correlation between the Close price and other features like Open, High, Low, and Volume.

### Automated Machine Learning:
- Uses the AutoTS library to:
  #### - Test dozens of different time series models (like ETS, ARIMA, FBProphet, GLM, and various naive/statistical models).
  #### - Run multiple validations to find the most accurate and robust model.
  #### - Create an ensemble of the best-performing models.

### Forecasting:
- Generates and displays a 30-day forecast for the Close price of Bitcoin.

## üß† Features Used

Key features engineered for the model include:

- Date: The timestamp for the trading day.
- Open: The price at which Bitcoin opened for the day.
- High: The highest price reached during the day. 
- Low: The lowest price reached during the day.
- Close: The price at which Bitcoin closed for the day.
- Volume: The total volume of BTC traded.

## ‚úÖ Future Enhancements

- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV or Optuna.  
- Incorporate **real-time data** from APIs (Binance, CoinGecko).  
- Add **multi-cryptocurrency support** (BTC, ETH, XRP, etc.).  
- Deploy the project as an **interactive dashboard** using **Streamlit** or **Dash**.  
- Integrate **sentiment analysis** from social media or news data to improve prediction accuracy.
