# 📈 Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project presents a machine learning model designed to predict sales based on various features such as store type, day of the week, promotions, and more. It's a complete end-to-end workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## 📁 Files Included

- `sales prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code for data analysis, visualization, model building, and evaluation.
- `sales.csv`: Dataset used to train and test the sales prediction models.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Businesses need accurate sales forecasts to make informed inventory and marketing decisions. This project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates future sales based on historical sales data and associated attributes.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Overview of dataset features
   - Visualizations and summary statistics
   - Correlation and distribution analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation
   - Train-test split

3. **Model Building**
   - Regression models used (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
   - Performance evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R² Score

4. **Evaluation and Visualization**
   - Predicted vs actual sales plots
   - Residual analysis
   - Feature importance visualization

## 📊 Features (Example)

> Actual features may vary depending on your dataset, but may include:

- Date
- Store ID
- Store Type
- Day of the Week
- Promotion
- Sales (Target)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add advanced time series models like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM

- Build a dashboard using Streamlit or Flask

- Include cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
