# 📉 Stock Market Crash Analysis with Python

This project provides an in-depth analysis of historical **Sensex stock market crashes** using Python. It uses exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical methods to identify trends and patterns during market downturns.

## 🔍 Objective

To explore and understand the behavior of the **Sensex index** during stock market crashes by:
- Visualizing key crash events.
- Identifying patterns and recovery trends.
- Providing data-driven insights.

## 📁 Files in this Repo

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `stock market crash analysis with python.ipynb` | Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, plots, and insights. |
| `cleaned_sensex.xlsx` | Cleaned dataset of Sensex values used for analysis. |
| `README.md` | Project overview and documentation. |

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for plotting
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📌 Key Insights

- Identified **major crash periods** with steep index drops.
- Visualized **recovery times** and **percentage losses** during crashes.
- Used statistical metrics to summarize crash behavior.



## ✅ Future Improvements

- Include more indices like Nifty 50, Dow Jones, etc.
- Add crash prediction model using machine learning.
- Use interactive dashboards (e.g., Streamlit or Plotly).
