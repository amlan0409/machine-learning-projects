## 🚀 Project Overview

This project:

✅ Uses **tokenization, stemming, and vectorization** on patient symptom data.  
✅ Calculates **cosine similarity** between medicines for recommendation.  
✅ Provides a **recommendation engine** suggesting top 5 similar medicines for any input medicine.  
✅ Ready for **deployment using Streamlit/Flask**.
