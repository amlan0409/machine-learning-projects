# Calories Burnt Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts the number of calories burnt based on user-specific physical parameters and activity metrics. The project leverages a dataset containing information such as age, gender, height, weight, duration of activity, and heart rate, and uses regression models to make predictions.

## 📂 Files

- `Calories_Burnt_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow—data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.
- `calories.csv`: Dataset used in this project for training and evaluation.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Merging**
   - Two datasets (if applicable) are merged for comprehensive feature representation.
   - Basic data cleaning is performed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualizations and correlation analysis help understand key relationships.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender).
   - Normalization or scaling (if required).

4. **Model Building**
   - Trains regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
   - Performance evaluated using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score.

5. **Predictions**
   - The trained model is used to predict calories burnt for test samples.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The notebook includes performance metrics and comparison of models used for regression to identify the best-performing model.

## 📊 Sample Features

- Age
- Gender
- Height (in cm)
- Weight (in kg)
- Duration of activity (in minutes)
